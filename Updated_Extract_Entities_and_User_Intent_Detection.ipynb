    "    {schema_json}\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### User Query\n",
    "    The user has input: \"{user_input}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Instructions\n",
    "    1. **Understand User Intent**:\n",
    "       - Carefully read the user query both left-to-right and right-to-left to identify potential entities, relationships, and operations.\n",
    "       - Use a \"chain of thoughts\" approach to break down the query into parts and analyze the intent for each segment.\n",
    "       - Identify if the query indicates aggregation (e.g., maximum, minimum, count) or specific entities (e.g., user names, project names, milestone names, status etc.).\n",
    "       - Ensure that synonyms and closely related terms are mapped accurately to schema components.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Extract Relevant Entities**:\n",
    "       - Match user input to text-based columns in the schema (e.g., `varchar`, `char`, `text`).\n",
    "       - Handle partial matches, synonyms, and spelling variations by considering contextual clues from the schema.\n",
    "       - Resolve foreign keys to their corresponding descriptive columns (e.g., `assigneeid` -> `username`,`projectid` -> `projectname`,`milestoneid` -> `milestonename`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Classify Query Type**:\n",
    "       - Determine if the query is:\n",
    "         a. An **aggregation query**, requiring calculations like maximum, minimum, or count.\n",
    "         b. An **entity-specific query**, focusing on particular items or details.\n",
    "       - Provide reasoning for the classification in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Expected Output Format**:\n",
    "       - A JSON object containing:\n",
    "         a. `query_type`: Either \"aggregation\" or \"entity_extraction\".\n",
    "         b. `intent_analysis`: A breakdown of user intent and reasoning.\n",
    "         c. `extracted_entities`: Relevant tables, columns, and matched values from the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Handle Foreign Keys Dynamically**:\n",
    "       - If a foreign key column exists (e.g., `assigneeid`,`projectid`,`milestoneid`) but points to a non-text field, exclude it.\n",
    "       - If the foreign key references a string-based column (e.g., `username`,`projectname`,`milestonename`), include only the string-based column from the related table.\n",

    "    The following entities have been extracted from the input:\n",
    "    {extracted_entities}\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Instructions\n",
    "    - The input may contain partial or similar names for entities, such as project names, user names, or status descriptions. Handle these using `ILIKE` operators with `%` on both sides of the string to allow flexible matching and accurate querying.\n",
    "    - **Do not use column names directly from user input** without validation. Cross-check user terms against the provided database schema and select the most relevant and existing columns.\n",
    "    - If the user input mentions a column that doesn't exist (e.g., `due_date`), **substitute it with a semantically similar, valid column** from the schema (e.g., use `end_date` if `due_date` is requested but not found).\n",
    "    - Ensure you match project names like 'IIFL Samasta', 'IIfl Samasta', 'IIFL', 'iifl smasta', 'Iiflsmsota' (or any spelling variations) to the correct project name from the database.\n",
    "    - Use the column `instnm` whenever the question involves institute names, and ensure it is correctly associated with `unitid` in the query.\n",
    "    - When context involves multiple tables, use JOIN operations, ensuring only appropriate columns (e.g., `unitid`) are used for these joins while maintaining referential integrity.\n",
    "    - **Whenever using foreign key columns**, always **select the corresponding string column from the related table** for clarity. For example, if `owner_id` from the `projects` table is a foreign key referencing `user_id` in the `users` table, select the `user_name` (or relevant name column) from the `users` table, not just the ID.\n",
    "    - For calculations such as averages or ratios, ensure proper aggregation using `AVG()`, `SUM()`, or other relevant functions, maintaining clarity and correctness in grouped results.\n",
    "    - Apply detailed filtering criteria from the input in the `WHERE` clause, using logical operators like `AND` and `OR` to combine conditions effectively.\n",
    "    - Use date and timestamp functions like `TO_TIMESTAMP()` and `EXTRACT` to handle date parsing and extraction of date components as needed.\n",
    "    - Employ the `GROUP BY` clause when aggregating by categories or attributes for clear grouping.\n",
    "    - Maintain readability with table and column aliases, especially for complex joins or subqueries.\n",
    "    - Utilize subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for breaking down complex logic into simpler, modular parts for better performance and clarity.\n",
    "    - Limit the number of rows in the result set to a maximum of 100 rows unless specified otherwise to optimize performance and avoid excessive data output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Ensure comprehensive understanding of user input and intent by interpreting queries from both left to right and right to left to capture full context.\n",
    "    - Use a range of SQL operators (`=`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `IN`) and functions (`IFNULL`, `ISNULL`, `COALESCE`) as needed to handle specific conditions, null handling, and flexible matching.\n",
    "    - Integrate advanced SQL clauses like `CASE` and `HAVING` when addressing conditional logic or grouped results.\n",
    "    - Safeguard the handling of NULLs to avoid logical errors, ensuring expressions that involve NULLs behave as expected.\n",
    "    - Address complex filtering by using nested conditions and logical operators, aligning the SQL with the nuanced requirements of the user query.\n",
    "    - Confirm all table relationships in JOINs are clear and maintain referential integrity to support correct data linkage.\n",
    "    - Prioritize performance by avoiding unnecessary complexity or inefficient constructs, focusing on optimized query design.\n",
    "    - Handle edge cases where user input may imply similar or interchangeable column names, ensuring the selected columns are contextually appropriate (e.g., using `end_date` instead of `due_date` if the former is present in the schema).\n",
    "    - **For foreign key relationships, always ensure that the related table’s string column (such as user names, project names, etc.) is also selected when referring to the foreign key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ensure the final SQL query is well-structured, efficient, and accurately reflects the user's request based on the provided input. The response should not include explanations, comments, or any other content beyond the generated SQL query.\n",
